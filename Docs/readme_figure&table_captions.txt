Figure 1: (Figure_1_plant_island)
Distributions of raw plant species richness (left) and the proportion of plants with zoochoric dispersal syndromes (right) 
related to the area of islands used in our analysis. 

Figure 2: (Figure_2_frugivore_map)
Species richness of birds (A) and reptiles (B) and the accumulated body mass of birds (C) and reptiles (D) for each island without our study region.
Each circle is sized according to each island's relative richness or accumulated mass.

Figure 3: (Figure_3_Bird_body_mass)
Distribution of the body mass of every bird species considered in our analysis.

Figure 4: (Figure_4_Reptile_body_mass)
Distribution of the body mass of every reptile species considered in our analysis.

Table 1: (Table 1-full_data)
Full dataset used in our analysis. 

Table 2: (Table 2-plant_dat)
Full catalog of seeded plants in the Caribbean according to Acevedo-Rodr√≠guez and Strong (2012).
Dispersal syndromes and life forms were researched and filled in for this study.

Table 3: (Table 3-frugivore_data)
Catalog of frugivorous vertebrates and their body mass according to our literature review.
Reference for the body mass of mammals are not included as they were not considered in our study.

Table 4: (Table 4-correlation_matrix)
Correlation matrix of the entire dataset (shown in Table 1).

Table 5: (Table 5 - final variables)
Final variables selected for our analysis, the justification, and references.
