Figure 1: (Figure_1_Plant_island)
Distributions of raw plant species richness (left) and the proportion of plants with zoochoric dispersal syndromes (right) 
related to the area of islands used in our analysis. 

Figure 2: (Figure_2_frugivore_map)
Species richness of birds (A) and reptiles (B) and the accumulated body mass of birds (C) and reptiles (D) for each island without our study region.
Each circle is sized according to each island's relative richness or accumulated mass.

Figure 3: (Figure_3_Frugivore_body_mass)
Density distribution of the body mass of every bird (black) and reptile (blue) species 
considered in our analysis. Anolis schwartzi (upper left: photo credit – iNaturalist) 
was among the lightest in our database and Cyclura cychlura (lower right: photo credit 2) 
was among the heaviest.

Table 1: (Table 1-Full_data)
Full dataset used in our analysis. The columns that end in "_points" (ex: abiotic_plant_points) 
are distributions estimated through purely occurence data, while those that do not (ex:abioitc_plant) were recovered 
using existing species distribution estimations from BIEN, IUCN, and BirdLife.

Table 2: (Table 2-plant_dat)
Full catalog of seeded plants in the Caribbean according to Acevedo-Rodríguez and Strong (2012).
Dispersal syndromes and life forms were researched and filled in for this study.

Table 3: (Table 3-Frugivore_data)
Catalog of frugivorous vertebrates and their body mass according to our literature review.
Reference for the body mass of mammals are not included as they were not considered in our study.

Table 4: (Table 4-Correlation_matrix)
Correlation matrix of the entire dataset (shown in Table 1).

Table 5: (Table 5 - final variables)
Final variables selected for our analysis, the justification, and references.
